Post 1:
I am looking to sell out and make money after graduation, my loyalty solely lies on the fact that i will be paid six figures to help you with your mathematical needs. I will stay loyal if I am paid what I deserve and will work my hardest to justify my salary. Life is no longer about anything other than staying afloat in the current economy. If I wish to support a family i must choose to sell out and sell myself to the highest bidder. Making a difference in the world is no longer financially feasible if youre middle class and lower.
